# [MUCSA Website](http://mucsa.org)

This repo holds the website for the Melbourne University Computing Association.

The site is built using the HTML5 Boilerplate template, Twitter Bootstrap CSS library and Rack for application hosting. The live version is deployed to Heroku.

If you have any suggestions for things to improve about the site, please email me at webmaster@mucsa.org and I will be eternally thankful.
